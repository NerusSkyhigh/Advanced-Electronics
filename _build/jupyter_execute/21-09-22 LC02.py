# # Multiplexers and demultiplexers
# ## Laboratory Class 02 - 22 September 2021
# 
# ### Topics
# - Hardware and software architectures:
#     - combinatorial and sequential circuits;
#     - synchronous and asynchronous circuits;
#     - example: asynchronous counter and synchronous version by means of a finite-state machine.
# - Basic hardware circuits:
#     - multiplexer;
#     - demultiplexer.
# - Verilog programming language:
#     - combinatorial (assign) and sequential (always) Verilog modules;
#     - basic modules implementing basic hardware circuits:
#         - multiplexer (synchronous and asynchronous version);
#         - synchronous counter with set to a preset value, and reset;
#     - blocking and non–blocking assignments.
# 
# ## Problems:
# - development of a stopwatch from 0 to 99.99 s (1/100 s resolution), with 2–digits BCD coding and a 2 x 4–LED array display;
# - development of a syncronous counter based on a “master clock”.
