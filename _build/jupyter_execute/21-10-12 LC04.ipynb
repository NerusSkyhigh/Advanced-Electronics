    "```{admonition} from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)\n",
    "A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. Finite-state machines are of two typesâ€”deterministic finite-state machines and non-deterministic finite-state machines. A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Despite the long mathematical definition state machines are simpler than first expected. They just define how to switch from a state to an other depending on an event. Let's make and example with a well know state machine: Pac Man's ghosts:\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*rVk-GYIMZJMD8Lxd)\n",
    "\n",
    "The image taken from [a medium article](https://mark-truluck.medium.com/the-machine-in-the-ghost-46f856f94ed2) explains the behaviour of the ghosts with states and how they transition from one state to an other accordin to events.\n",
    "\n",
    "States machines can be easily implemented with ```if-else```, ```switch``` construct and ```enums```. Each case correspond to a state and the condition to the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Latches\n",
    "A data latch is just a way to use D Flip-Flops to store data. Usually a data latch (or register) will store a new value only on a positive edge and will preserve the old value otherwise."
