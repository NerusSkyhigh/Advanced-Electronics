    "In the previous lecture we gave some basic definitions and showed that a LTI system is fully characterized by its **impulse response**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting property of LTI systems is that it is possible to imagine them the impulse response and the input sequence as the two inputs of a convolution. This means that is is possible to freely swap the input sequence and the impulse response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    x[n] \\rightarrow [SYSTEM] \\rightarrow y[n] &\\implies (x[n], h[n]) \\rightarrow [CONVOLUTION] \\rightarrow y[n] \\\\\n",
    "    &\\implies (h[n], x[n]) \\rightarrow [CONVOLUTION] \\rightarrow y[n]\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Matematically:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] h[n-k]\\quad \\xrightarrow[k'=n-k]{k=k'-n} \\quad \\sum_{k'=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n-k'] h[k']\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now discuss three important features that a system can have, namely **reality**, **causality / non causality** and **marginal stability / bibo stability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key properties of a system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reality\n",
    "A system is said to be real iff $h[n]\\in \\mathcal{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Non) Causality\n",
    "A system is said to be causal (or nonanticipative) iff $h[n] = 0 \\textit{ if } n<0$. An equivalent definition is: the output $y[n_{0}]$ depends on only the input $x[n]$ for values of $n < n_{0}$. The idea behind this property is that the output depends only on past inputs and not on future inputs.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "A non causal system is defined **by substituting the \"less than\" with a \"greater than\"**: <br/>\n",
    "A system is said to be causal (or nonanticipative) iff $h[n] = 0 \\textit{ if } n>0$. An equivalent definition is: the output $y[t_{0}]$ depends on only the input $x[n]$ for values of $t>n_{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "A system can be BOTH causal and NON CAUSAL. A class of systems that satisfy this properties are amplifiers $h[n]= \\alpha\\ \\delta[n]$. These kind of systems respect both conditions as the have $h[n]=0$ for both $t<0$ and $t>0$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marginal Stability\n",
    "A system is marginal stable iff $\\exists L<+\\infty\\ :\\ |h[n]| \\leq L\\ \\forall n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of marginal stable system is one with $h[n]=U[n]\\leq 1$ (*the integrator*):\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{+\\infty} x[k] U[n-k] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} x[k]\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "### BIBO Stability\n",
    "A system is BIBO Stable (Bounded Input - Bounded Output) if to each and every bounded input $x[n]$ it corresponds a bounded output.\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\forall\\ x[n]\\ :\\ |x[n]|<+\\infty \\implies \\exists L<\\infty\\ :\\ |y[n]|<L \\forall n\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e.g. BIBO Stable system \n",
    "An amplifiers is a BIBO stable system (trivial if we take$L=\\max_{n}\\{x[n]\\}\\times\\alpha$) but an integrator is not. If we choose $x[n]=U[n]$ we have:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} U[k] = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} 1 = n+1\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "so I can just choose $n=L$ to \"surpass\" every $L$ I've chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Th: BIBO Stability\n",
    "```{admonition} Theorem\n",
    "Condition sufficient and necessary for a system to be BIBO Stable is that $h[n]$ is **absolutely convergent**, that is $\\exists L <\\infty\\ :\\ \\sum_{n}|h[n]| \\le L$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of sufficiency ($\\impliedby$)\n",
    "Assume the input sequence to be bounded $|x[n]| \\leq L\\in\\mathcal{R}^{+}\\ \\forall n$ and apply the Cauchyâ€“Schwarz inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    |y[n]| = |\\sum_{k} h[k] x[n-k]| \\leq \\sum_{k} |h[k]|\\ |x[n-k]| \\leq \\max_{k}\\{h[k]\\} \\sum_{k} |h[n-k]| \\leq \\max_{k}\\{h[k]\\} L < +\\infty\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of necessity ($\\implies$)\n",
    "The proof of necessity is a bit trickier. Instead of the direct why we will work \"ad absurdum\" by proving that *if $h[k]$ is NOT absolutely convergent then the system is NOT BIBO stable*. This proof works because the other cases were already taken care of [^cases].\n",
    "\n",
    "[^cases]: Let's list the cases for clarity's sake:\n",
    "    - $h[k]$ is NOT absolutely convergent $\\implies$ S is NOT BIBO stable: it's the proof\n",
    "    - $h[k]$ is absolutely convergent $\\implies$ S is NOT BIBO stable: impossible for the \"Proof of sufficiency\"\n",
    "    - $h[k]$ is NOT absolutely convergent $\\implies$ S is BIBO stable: it's in the proof\n",
    "    - $h[k]$ is absolutely convergent $\\implies$ S is BIBO stable: that's what we are aiming for\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's consider a sequence defined as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    x[n] = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{lr}\n",
    "        \\frac{h^*[-n]}{|h[-n]|} \\quad \\textit{if} \\quad |h[-n]|\\neq 0\\\\\n",
    "        0  \\quad \\textit{if} \\quad |h[-n]| = 0\\\n",
    "        \\end{array}\\right.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Now we evaluate the output of said system in n=0 and use the fact that $h[n]$ is NOT absolutely convergent:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    y[n] = \\sum_{k} h[k] \\frac{h^*[k-n]}{|h[k-n]|} \\rightarrow y[0] = \\sum_{k} h[k] \\frac{h^*[k]}{|h[k]|} = \\sum_k |h[k]| = +\\infty\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "With this this we proved that if $h[k]$ is not absolutely convergent then the system can not be BIBO stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stability of a sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometime we will talk about BIBO stability of a sequence. In this context it means $\\sum_n |x[n]| < +\\infty$.\n",
