    "I think everything important I can say is said in [this video](https://youtu.be/ys1ftk5a2A4) and on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).\n",

    "## ADC and DAC\n",
    "They both work in a similar way: the first tries to approximate the analog signal with a counter. Usually it works in _bipolar_ coordinates with $3.3V$ standard and output a number according to the formula:\n",
    "$$V_{D} = \\frac{V_{A}-1.65V}{3.3V}2^{n}$$\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of bits in the ADC.\n",
    "DAC will instead output a signal encoded as _unipolar_ coordinates where, assuming a $3.3V$ standard, $1.65V$ represent the zero and the output is given by:\n",
    "$$ V_{A}=\\frac{\\mathcal{bits}(V_{D})}{2^{n}}3.3V$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to pass back and forth between _unipolar_ and _bipolar_ coordinates by negating the first bit.\n",

    "## Evaluation of the Nyquist frequency\n",
    "This one is a nice one to do."
