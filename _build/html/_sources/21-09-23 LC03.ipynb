    "Flip flops work due to internal delays that are essential to their implementation. A drawback of this is that, in rare circumstances, the clock may be too fast and have a period smaller than the internal delay giving rise to unreliable behaviors.\n",

    "If the T input is high, the T flip-flop changes state (\"toggles\") whenever the clock input is strobed. If the T input is low, the flip-flop holds the previous value. This behavior can be described in a truth table:\n",

    "A monostable multivibrator, also called a one shot or a monoflop, is a sequential logic electronic circuit that generates an output pulse. When triggered, a pulse of pre-defined duration is produced. The circuit then returns to its stable state and produces no more output until triggered again.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful application of monostable multivibrators is *debouncing circuits*[^debouncing].\n",

    "\n",
    "As it is shown in the image taken from [hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2015/12/09/embed-with-elliot-debounce-your-noisy-buttons-part-i/), when a button is pressed or released the circuit will sense multiple inputs due to the mechanical nature of buttons. When a correct detection is essential, it is usually essential to introduce a monostable multivibrator as a debouncing circuit. After the first pulse, the monostable will ignore any input, like the infamous bounces, up until a predetermined time has elapsed. This will guarantee that only one input is detected in the time frame chosen. The only job left is to find the appropriate window where the bounces are ignored but multiple consecutive presses are detected. If the button is pressed by a human, usually a few milliseconds will do the job.\n",
