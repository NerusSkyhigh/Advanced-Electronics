Finally, this book is written on _Jupyter Notebook_ using markdown so that we have the simplicity of markdown and the power of Latex and a python engine (I love high-level languages for fast prototyping and I'm not scared to admit so). Here is a fast guide to the markdown syntax [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax). A nice template to start with is the "notebooks.ipynb" on the home folder of the master branch.
