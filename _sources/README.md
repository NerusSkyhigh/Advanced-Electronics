Finally, this book is written on [_Jupyter Book_](https://jupyterbook.org) using markdown so that we have the simplicity of Markdown syntax, the power of Latex, and the effectiveness of a python engine (I love high-level languages for fast prototyping and I'm not scared to admit so). Here you can find a brief introcution to the markdown syntax: [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax). A handy template to start with is the "notebooks.ipynb" on the home folder of the master branch.
