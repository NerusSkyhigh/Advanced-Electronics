In the previous lecture we gave some basic definitions and showed that a LTI system is fully characterized by its **impulse response**.

An interesting property of LTI systems is that it is possible to imagine them the impulse response and the input sequence as the two inputs of a convolution. This means that is is possible to freely swap the input sequence and the impulse response.

\begin{align*}
    x[n] \rightarrow [SYSTEM] \rightarrow y[n] &\implies (x[n], h[n]) \rightarrow [CONVOLUTION] \rightarrow y[n] \\
    &\implies (h[n], x[n]) \rightarrow [CONVOLUTION] \rightarrow y[n]
\end{align*}

Matematically:
\begin{align*}
    y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] h[n-k]\quad \xrightarrow[k'=n-k]{k=k'-n} \quad \sum_{k'=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n-k'] h[k']
\end{align*}

We will now discuss three important features that a system can have, namely **reality**, **causality / non causality** and **marginal stability / bibo stability**.

## Key properties of a system

### Reality
A system is said to be real iff $h[n]\in \mathcal{R}$.

### (Non) Causality
A system is said to be causal (or nonanticipative) iff $h[n] = 0 \textit{ if } n<0$. An equivalent definition is: the output $y[n_{0}]$ depends on only the input $x[n]$ for values of $n < n_{0}$. The idea behind this property is that the output depends only on past inputs and not on future inputs.
 

A non causal system is defined **by substituting the "less than" with a "greater than"**: <br/>
A system is said to be causal (or nonanticipative) iff $h[n] = 0 \textit{ if } n>0$. An equivalent definition is: the output $y[t_{0}]$ depends on only the input $x[n]$ for values of $t>n_{0}$.


```{note}
A system can be BOTH causal and NON CAUSAL. A class of systems that satisfy this properties are amplifiers $h[n]= \alpha\ \delta[n]$. These kind of systems respect both conditions as the have $h[n]=0$ for both $t<0$ and $t>0$.
```

### Marginal Stability
A system is marginal stable iff $\exists L<+\infty\ :\ |h[n]| \leq L\ \forall n$.

An example of marginal stable system is one with $h[n]=U[n]\leq 1$ (*the integrator*):
\begin{equation*}
    y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} x[k] U[n-k] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{n} x[k]
\end{equation*}

### BIBO Stability
A system is BIBO Stable (Bounded Input - Bounded Output) if to each and every bounded input $x[n]$ it corresponds a bounded output.
\begin{equation*}
    \forall\ x[n]\ :\ |x[n]|<+\infty \implies \exists L<\infty\ :\ |y[n]|<L \forall n
\end{equation*}

#### e.g. BIBO Stable system 
An amplifiers is a BIBO stable system (trivial if we take$L=\max_{n}\{x[n]\}\times\alpha$) but an integrator is not. If we choose $x[n]=U[n]$ we have:
\begin{equation*}
    y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{n} U[k] = \sum_{k=0}^{n} 1 = n+1
\end{equation*}
so I can just choose $n=L$ to "surpass" every $L$ I've chosen.

### Th: BIBO Stability
```{admonition} Theorem
Condition sufficient and necessary for a system to be BIBO Stable is that $h[n]$ is **absolutely convergent**, that is $\exists L <\infty\ :\ \sum_{n}|h[n]| \le L$.
```

#### Proof of sufficiency ($\impliedby$)
Assume the input sequence to be bounded $|x[n]| \leq L\in\mathcal{R}^{+}\ \forall n$ and apply the Cauchyâ€“Schwarz inequality:

\begin{align*}
    |y[n]| = |\sum_{k} h[k] x[n-k]| \leq \sum_{k} |h[k]|\ |x[n-k]| \leq \max_{k}\{h[k]\} \sum_{k} |h[n-k]| \leq \max_{k}\{h[k]\} L < +\infty
\end{align*}


#### Proof of necessity ($\implies$)
The proof of necessity is a bit trickier. Instead of the direct why we will work "ad absurdum" by proving that *if $h[k]$ is NOT absolutely convergent then the system is NOT BIBO stable*. This proof works because the other cases were already taken care of [^cases].

[^cases]: Let's list the cases for clarity's sake:
    - $h[k]$ is NOT absolutely convergent $\implies$ S is NOT BIBO stable: it's the proof
    - $h[k]$ is absolutely convergent $\implies$ S is NOT BIBO stable: impossible for the "Proof of sufficiency"
    - $h[k]$ is NOT absolutely convergent $\implies$ S is BIBO stable: it's in the proof
    - $h[k]$ is absolutely convergent $\implies$ S is BIBO stable: that's what we are aiming for
    
Let's consider a sequence defined as:
\begin{equation}
    x[n] = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
        \frac{h^*[-n]}{|h[-n]|} \quad \textit{if} \quad |h[-n]|\neq 0\\
        0  \quad \textit{if} \quad |h[-n]| = 0\
        \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
Now we evaluate the output of said system in n=0 and use the fact that $h[n]$ is NOT absolutely convergent:
\begin{align*}
    y[n] = \sum_{k} h[k] \frac{h^*[k-n]}{|h[k-n]|} \rightarrow y[0] = \sum_{k} h[k] \frac{h^*[k]}{|h[k]|} = \sum_k |h[k]| = +\infty
\end{align*}

With this this we proved that if $h[k]$ is not absolutely convergent then the system can not be BIBO stable.


### Stability of a sequence

Sometime we will talk about BIBO stability of a sequence. In this context it means $\sum_n |x[n]| < +\infty$.


## Difference equations

A discrete way to characterize LTI systems other than differential equation and their solution are difference equations. The most generic form of difference equation is
\begin{equation*}
    y[n] = y[n-1] + y[n-2] + x[n]
\end{equation*}

### e.g. Fibonacci sequence
\begin{equation*}
f[n] = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
        0  \quad \textit{if} \quad n\leq 0\\
        1  \quad \textit{if} \quad n = 0\\
        f[n] = f[n-1] + f[n-2]
        \end{array}\right.
\end{equation*}
Where the first two conditions are the input / initial conditions.

### exercise

Let's consider $y[n]=ay[n-1] + x[0]\delta[n]$. How can we find $h[n]$?

To do that, let's divide both sides by the input $x[n]$ so that we obtain the $h[n]=a h[n-1]+\delta[n]$ and distinguish the two cases where $h[n]$ is causal or non causal:

#### $h[n]$ is Causal

If $h[n]$ is causal it has to satisfy the condition $h[n]=0$ if $n<0$. It is then possible to write:
- $h[0] = a h[0-1] + \delta[0] = a\cdot0 + 1=1$
- $h[1] = a h[1-1] + \delta[1] = a\cdot 1 + 0=a$
- $h[0] = a h[2-1] + \delta[2] = a\cdot a + 0=a^2$
- ...
- $\implies h[n]=a^n$.

#### $h[n]$ is Non Causal
If $h[n]$ is non causal it has to satisfy the condition $h[n]=0$ if $n>0$. By inverting the difference equation it is possible to write:
- $h[n-1] = (h[n]-\delta[n])/a$
- $h[0] = (h[1]-\delta[1])/a = (0-0)/a = 0$
- $h[-1] = (h[0]-\delta[0])/a = (0-1)/a = -1/a$
- $h[-2] = (h[-1]-\delta[-1])/a = (-1/a-0)/a = -1/a^2$
- $h[-3] = (h[-2]-\delta[-2])/a = (-1/a^2-0)/a = -1/a^3$
- ...
- $\implies h[n]=-1 \cdot U[-n-1] \cdot a^{n}$



So by considering both cases it is possible to find the value of $h[n]$:

\begin{equation*}
h[n] = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
        h[n]=a^n  \quad \textit{if CAUSAL}\\
        h[n]=-U[-n-1] a^{n}  \quad \textit{if NON CAUSAL}
        \end{array}\right.
\end{equation*}
